# Fetch users from a public api and display using react app.

This project is a React JS app that displays a list of Star Wars characters fetched from a public API endpoint. Users are displayed on cards containing information such as name, a random picture, hair color, skin color, gender, and count of vehicles they have. The background color of each card is based on the user's hair color. Additionally, the app provides pagination for navigating through the list of users and a search input to filter users by name.
